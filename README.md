## Access management
#### All stakeholders have access to our wall of work on GitHub through the link provided by the team for them. Our wall of work is connected to our GitHub repository, so for privacy reasons, not everyone with the link can see the tasks related to our repository on the wall of work. For example, if there is a bug at some stage of development and we create an issue on our GitHub, we relate this issue to a wall of work task, so that people who have access to our repo will be able to see the task and people who don't have access to the repo but the wall of work company was this task of the wall of work as private.

## Repository access policy

#### All stakeholders with technical knowledge who require access to GitHub will be invited by private invitation and will only have access through the invited account. We will verify with the product owner if the stakeholder needs access and that the account is approved for access.

## Separation of environments:

#### The project will be designed around different environments:
* Pre-production environment
* Testing environment
* Production environment

### Pre-production environment

#### In this environment, the databases will be local to reduce communication risks and streamline the construction process of both frontend and backend.

### Test environment:

#### This environment will have different possibilities with tester tools to test both the front end and the backend and the database.

### Production environment:

#### This environment will have all the security measures and will be connected to the project database, this environment is focused on finished and tested features.

## Repository change management policies:

#### For change management we will have a branch for each member of the development team. When a change is made in the personal branch of the developer, this developer will make a merge request to main, this request will be analyzed by at least one other member of the team to be approved. The work base will always be the main breach, so it is necessary for all members to be up to date with it before adding or modifying things.

## Communication plan with stakeholders:

#### We have stakeholders for each of the project user types:

* OP Managers
* Managers
* Finance

As well as a communication plan with the product owner and technical stakeholders through the Slack platform
